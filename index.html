                Eivind Johansson Vullum (b.1984) is a Norwegian musician, sound designer and DJ. 
                Vullum has since the early 2000s been active in different bands such as the 
                kraut/psych-pop four-piece Sally Suicide. From there, he ventured into a more 
                electronic direction sonically. He was one half of the hardware techno duo Bloksberg, 
                which made a name for itself with its leftfield techno in clubs both inside and 
                outside Norway. As a DJ and promoter, he presented his concept Klubb Kadabra at 
                the club Blå in Oslo for over three years, focusing on promoting local underground DJs.

                Vullum holds a BA in Sound Design from the Nordic Institute of Stage and Studio (NISS) 
                and is currently studying Musicology at the University of Oslo. Over the last few 
                years he has worked in sound design and music production for short films and other 
                visual projects such as the interactive installation Speisa –performed at the Ultima 
                contemporary music festival in Oslo– and for the Kube Art Museum in Ålesund. 
                His most recent collaboration has been with the artist Thyra Dragseth.

                Ohms Love is Eivind Johansson Vullum’s debut solo LP. It consists of a selection of 
                tracks made over a four-year period. Drawing from his experience in field recording, 
                film music composition and club event curation, Eivind sets forth a seamless 
                collection of melodic and meditative beat-free music that stands out yet fits in 
                the rich history of Norwegian ambient music. The form of Vullum’s electronic 
                compositions reflects his background as a sound designer, which has had a strong 
                influence on the dynamics and the narrative elements in his music. Ohms Love will 
                be released on HMD Records in autumn 2021.
